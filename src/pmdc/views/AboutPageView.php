                    <p class="card-text">I originally came up with this idea a few days ago, and i was inspired by <a href="http://devathon.org">devathon.org</a>. It is an awesome idea and it hasn't been done in the Minecraft: Pocket Edition community yet. So i thought to myself, 'why not do it!?'. And i did.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The contest is also loosly based off of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MCPE/comments/6gm3o1/fortnightly_building_challenge_11_june_25_june/">Fortnightly Building Challenge</a> over on /r/mcpe. I originally thought of just creating a reddit post like FBC, but i decided against it.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">The code structure of this site is based off of <a href="http://poggit.pmmp.io">Poggit</a>, an amazing plugin repository created by the devs @ PocketMine.</p>
