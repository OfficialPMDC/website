The PocketMine Development Challenge.

### What is this?
It is a fortnightly plugin development contest for [PocketMine-MP](https//pmmp.io). A developer has a set amount of time to register on the site, create a plugin, and push it to GitHub. 
They also must follow certain rules which will be layed out on the site in the future.

### How can i run it?
I *don't want* you to run this. It defeats the whole point of the contest. And anyway, it's still in development.
